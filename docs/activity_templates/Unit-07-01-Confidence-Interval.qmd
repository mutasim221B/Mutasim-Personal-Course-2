You can download the .qmd file for this activity [here](../activity_templates/Unit-07-01-Confidence-Interval.qmd) and open in R-studio. The rendered version is posted in the [course website](https://mutasim221b.github.io/Mutasim-Personal-Course-2/) (Activities tab). I often experiment with the class activities (and see it in live!) and make updates, but I always post the final version before class starts. To be sure you have the most up-to-date copy, please download it once you’ve settled in before class begins.

# Notes

## Learning goals

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:


- Explain the goal of a confidence interval and why we use samples to estimate an unknown population mean $\mu$
- Construct confidence interval for a population mean $\mu$ when the population standard deviation ($\sigma$) is known and when it is unknown
- Distinguish between correct and incorrect interpretations of confidence intervals
- Describe how confidence level, variability, and sample size affect the width of an interval
- Use the margin of error to determine the required sample size 
- Use a confidence interval to recover the sample information.

# Recall...

## Sampling Distribution and Central Limit Theorem

Before constructing confidence intervals, let us recall how the **sample mean** behaves across repeated samples.

### Central Limit Theorem (Big Picture)

- If the population is **normal**, the sample mean $\bar{y}$ is normally distributed for any sample size.
- Even if the population is **not normal**, the sample mean is approximately normal when the sample size is large ($n \ge 30$).



::: {.callout-important}
#### Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean

If $Y$ has population mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, then

$$
\bar{Y} \sim N\!\left(\mu,\; \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right)
$$

when

- the population is normal, **or**
- the sample size is large ($n \ge 30$).

# Confidence Interval

## What is a Confidence Interval?

A **confidence interval (CI)** is a plausible range of values used to estimate an unknown population parameter, such as a population mean $\mu$, based on data from a random sample. 

Rather than reporting a single point estimate (for example, “the average screen time is 3 hours per day”), a confidence interval provides a range of plausible values together with a chosen confidence level (e.g., $95\%$).

A confidence interval reflects the long-run reliability of the method used to construct the interval. If we were to repeatedly take random samples from the same population and compute a confidence interval each time, then approximately $(1-\alpha)100\%$ of those intervals would capture the true population mean $\mu$. 

It is important to remember that-

- The true population parameter $\mu$ is a **fixed but unknown constant**.
The **interval endpoints vary** from sample to sample because they depend on random data.  
  Play this interactive simulation of confidence intervals (Rossman/Chance): <https://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/ConfSim.html>
  
Change the Statsitc to Proportion to Mean and then click on ``Sample"!
**Question:**  
How many times did you observe a confidence interval change from a **green** line to a **red** line when the interval failed to capture the population mean at 0.5?




## Common MISINTERPRETATIONS


- Misinterpretation 1: "There is a 95% probability that the population parameter is within (a,b)."
    - **Response:** The population parameter is not random. It is either in the interval or not, so the probability is 1 or 0. The 95% means that 95% of random samples (that are representative of the population of interest) are expected to contain the true population parameter---"95% confidence" is describing confidence in the interval construction process.

- Misinterpretation 2: "There is a 5% probability that the population parameter is not within (a,b)."
    - **Response:** This is incorrect for the same reason as the first misinterpretation.
    
See the class handouts for more MISINTERPRETATIONS!





## CI for $\mu$ when $\sigma$ is known

We use this setup when the population standard deviation $\sigma$ is known and the sampling distribution of $\bar{Y}$ is normal (either the population is normal or $n$ is large).

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Math Box: CI for $\mu$ when $\sigma$ is known

If $\sigma$ is known, then a $(1-\alpha)100\%$ confidence interval for the population mean $\mu$ is

$$
\bar{Y} \pm z_{\alpha/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}.
$$

Equivalently,

$$
\left(\bar{Y} - z_{\alpha/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}, \;\; \bar{Y} + z_{\alpha/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right).
$$
:::



## Margin of Error and Sample Size

The **margin of error** is the “plus/minus” part of the confidence interval.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Math Box: Margin of Error

For a $(1-\alpha)100\%$ confidence interval for $\mu$ (when $\sigma$ is known), the margin of error is

$$
\text{ME} = z_{\alpha/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}.
$$

If we want the margin of error to equal a specific small number $B$, then we can set

$$
z_{\alpha/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = B
$$

and solve for the required sample size:

$$
n = \left(\frac{z_{\alpha/2}\sigma}{B}\right)^2.
$$
:::


## CI for $\mu$ when $\sigma$ is unknown

When $\sigma$ is unknown (which is typical), we replace $\sigma$ with the sample standard deviation $s$, and we use a **$t$-critical value** instead of a $z$-critical value.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Math Box: CI for $\mu$ when $\sigma$ is unknown

If $\sigma$ is unknown, then a $(1-\alpha)100\%$ confidence interval for the population mean $\mu$ is

$$
\bar{Y} \pm t_{\alpha/2,\;n-1}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}},
$$

where $t_{\alpha/2,\;n-1}$ is the $t$ critical value with $n-1$ degrees of freedom.

Equivalently,

$$
\left(\bar{Y} - t_{\alpha/2,\;n-1}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}, \;\; \bar{Y} + t_{\alpha/2,\;n-1}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\right).
$$
