Whether in life or research, we’re often interested in relationships between 2+ variables. For example, how is one’s commute time to class related to their distance from campus and mode of transportation? Or, how is voter participation related to a person’s age and political affiliation? Statistical modeling is the art and science of turning data into information about such relationships of interest.\nBeing able to summarize, interpret, and communicate about data are crucial for navigating today’s information landscape, and these are precisely the skills that we’ll build in this class. Throughout the semester, we’ll study the fundamental methods that statisticians use to extract knowledge from data, emphasizing statistical literacy & intuition, real data applications, and modern computing over memorizing facts and formulas."

You can call me Bill or Professor Billah & I use he/him pronouns. Back when I was an undergrad student, I didn’t have the best experience in Intro Stat—those courses often emphasized formulas over real understanding. That experience has shaped my teaching—I concentrate on illustrating how statistical theories connect and can be applied in the real world. I’m excited to teach Introduction to Statistical Modeling and to create a more meaningful experience—one that helps all students feel confident applying it beyond the classroom. My methodological research lies at the intersection of statistical genetics, biostatistics, and genomics. My current research interests include developing novel statistical methods and computationally efficient bioinformatics tools, leveraging modern machine- and deep-learning approaches analyze high-dimensional next-generation sequencing and multi-omics data to identify genes and regulatory mechanisms underlying complex diseases. Outside of my academic work, I enjoy spending time outdoors with family and friends or cooking variety of foods. If you can’t find me anywhere, I might be busy playing soccer or exploring new worlds on my PS5 or PSVR!\n\n\nDrop-in (office) hours:\n\nLocation: My office\nTimes: M/W/F: 01:30-02:30 pm.\nBy Appointment: I’m also happy to meet one-on-one! Shoot me an email and we can arrange it either in-person or over zoom, password: 123456.\nEmail Response Time: I do my best to reply to emails promptly during weekdays.\nPlease note that messages sent after 5:00 pm or on weekends may take longer to receive a response."

You may use AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, etc), with some caveats & limitations:\n\nAI is often wrong, thus is not a good resource on topics for which you don’t yet have expertise. Relatedly, though AI can be helpful with parts of a statistical analysis (eg: getting unstuck on code, checking grammar), you have to guide that process (eg: what questions are we trying to answer? what’s a reasonable approach?).\nWork on an exercise for at least 30 minutes before even thinking about AI. You will learn very little if you overly rely on AI, hence be unprepared for other interactions with the material (eg: in-class discussions, quizzes, future courses that build upon 155, etc). Learning comes from you doing the puzzling, not from you producing a correct answer.\nWhether or not you use AI, you must be able to defend/explain any code/discussion you hand in. You cannot simply use AI to bypass your own learning.\nYou may not use AI to generate entire arguments or discussions. Putting code and discussions into your own words is critical for your own deeper learning, independent thinking, and creativity. (For example, imagine how little you’d learn in a language course if you simply used AI to translate all text for you!!)\nAny use of AI must be cited, just like any other resource. Using AI without citation, to generate entire discussions / code blocks, or without being able to defend the results.

Investing time into taking care of yourself will have profound impacts on all aspects of your life. Remember that beyond being a student, you are a human being carrying your own experiences, thoughts, emotions, and identities. It is important to acknowledge any stressors you may be facing, which can be mental, emotional, physical, cultural, financial, etc., and how they can have an impact on you. I encourage you to remember that you have a body with needs. In the classroom, eat when you are hungry, drink water, use the restroom, and step out if you are upset and need some air. Please do what is necessary so long as it does not impede your or others’ ability to be mentally and emotionally present in the course. Outside of the classroom, sleeping well, moving your body, and connecting with others can be strategies can help nourish you."

    "text": "What is a Confidence Interval?\nA confidence interval (CI) is a plausible range of values used to estimate an unknown population parameter, such as a population mean \\(\\mu\\), based on data from a random sample.\nRather than reporting a single point estimate (for example, “the average screen time is 3 hours per day”), a confidence interval provides a range of plausible values together with a chosen confidence level (e.g., \\(95\\%\\)).\nA confidence interval reflects the long-run reliability of the method used to construct the interval. If we were to repeatedly take random samples from the same population and compute a confidence interval each time, then approximately \\((1-\\alpha)100\\%\\) of those intervals would capture the true population mean \\(\\mu\\).\nIt is important to remember that-\n\nThe true population parameter \\(\\mu\\) is a fixed but unknown constant. The interval endpoints vary from sample to sample because they depend on random data.\nPlay this interactive simulation of confidence intervals (Rossman/Chance): https://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/ConfSim.html\n\nChange the Statsitc to Proportion to Mean and then click on ``Sample”! Question:\nHow many times did you observe a confidence interval change from a green line to a red line when the interval failed to capture the population mean at 0.5?",

It is either in the interval or not, so the probability is 1 or 0. The 95% means that 95% of random samples (that are representative of the population of interest) are expected to contain the true population parameter—“95% confidence” is describing confidence in the interval construction process.\n\nMisinterpretation 2: “There is a 5% probability that the population parameter is not within (a,b).”\n\nResponse: This is incorrect for the same reason as the first misinterpretation.\n\n\nSee the class handouts for more MISINTERPRETATIONS!",
