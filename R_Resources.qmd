## Getting Help


- [RStudio cheatsheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/)
- [Markdown (Quarto) basics](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html), and [Quarto/RStudio tutorial](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html)
- **Google it!** If you have a question about R, someone else probably asked it. Add **“R tidyverse”** to your search term.  
  Example: *scatterplot R tidyverse*
- **Note about ChatGPT for code**: Please avoid using ChatGPT as a first resort for R code. It often suggests overly wordy or unfamiliar approaches. Our goal is for you to understand the code you write; sticking to tools and syntax we use in class will support your learning best.
- More details will be shared soon as we begin the project.
